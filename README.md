#telegram-bot-management-app

#App description

A basic Node.Js application to manage a telegram bot.

#Functionalities
At this moment, it's possible to listen a conversation in Telegram and identify words or expressions using Regex, and then send a specific sticker or a message.

#Features to be add
First, I pretend to store the relations Regex rule/Sticker and Regex rule/Message in a database.
Then, use telegram bot commands like /add-sticker-match or /add-message-match to manage this relations only using Telegram.
